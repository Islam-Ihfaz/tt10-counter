## How it works

This Verilog design implements a 4-bit synchronous up-counter with reset and enable control signals.

## How to test

Initialize the clock, reset, and enable signals. First assert the reset and then re-assert the reset. Then start counting by setting the enable = 1. Stop counting by setting enable = 0. After counting ends, end the simulation. See the testbench for more details.
